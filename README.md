## Topic: EMRS(Electronic report System) 
## description : 
Assume a condition where a person visits a hospital with a reccurring trauma after a year but he lost all his past records and medical history.
now the idea was to connect all such or other patients through a central report managing system used by hostpital authorities. A patient gets his unique system generated 6 charactered id which doctors can use all over the city or lets assume globe. doctors can update their data using their own descriptive ids so that patient's prescription and other medical history remains totally and permanenly updated and stored in the server. System stores one time entry data like name , address , contact , blood group and any co-morbities. updated data includes ids of all consulted doctors and their respective preffered priscriptions. doctor needs to just use his id to verify him to the system and then can use patients id to fetch patient details even if person is not in the condition of speaking or answering.
